# numerals

Clojure library, suitable for use in a server-side application, that can take a
Java int in the range 0 to 999,999,999 inclusive and returns the equivalent number,
as a String, in British English words.

##Sample data
Input/Output  
0 zero
1 one
21 twenty one
105 one hundred and five
123 one hundred and twenty three
1005 one thousand and five
1042 one thousand and forty two
1105 one thousand one hundred and five
56945781 fifty six million nine hundred and forty five thousand seven hundred and eighty one

##Guidelines

Make use of git and commit often to capture the steps and progression in
development
Please pay attention to the specific conventions of British English, particularly
concerning the use of ‘and’ between certain phrases.
The solution is not expected to involve a command line or GUI application –
we’re looking for a Clojure library that could be packaged as a jar and used in a
larger application.
The solution should not make use of external libraries other than for testing
purposes.
The solution should demonstrate a candidate’s abilities as a software engineer
including, for example, TDD principles, general functional programming principles and domain modelling principles.
